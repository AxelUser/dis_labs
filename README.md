Laboratory works on Distributed Information Systems

Here we go:
 - Lab 1: Simple local chat, where clients communicate with each other by Memory Mapped File;
 - Lab 2: Simple input service with message encryption, that provides mapping from CSV to database. Client and server communicate with each other either by socket, or by Message Queue (RabbitMQ);
 - Lab 3: Simple web-app which will help you to make right decision. ;) Was made using asp.net MVC 5, WebAPI 2 and VueJS.
